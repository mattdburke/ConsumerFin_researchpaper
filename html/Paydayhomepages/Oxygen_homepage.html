If for any reason you find that you will be unable to meet the agreed upon repayments or feel that these repayments will be too difficult, you must contact the provider of your loan as soon as possible.<p>By contacting your unique lender, you’ll be informed of any possibility to reschedule or otherwise restructure your loan repayments, or discuss other options necessary to avoid adverse action. It’s important to remember that altering or adjusting the repayment structure of your loan can result in increased charges or interest.<p>Any specific questions regarding your actual loan agreement should be addressed directly to your lender. If you do not attempt to contact your lender and instead default on any part of your established repayment schedule, the lender reserves the right to make your details readily available to third-party debt collection agencies to recover the debt accordingly.<p>While specific lending policies will vary, lenders typically reserve the right to utilize Continuous Payment Authority to take payments directly from your card and/or account up to ninety (90) days past your due date. This action may only occur if it’s been agreed upon within the terms and conditions of your signed loan agreement.<p>It’s important to review this agreement carefully before finalizing your loan, as any rules or regulations associated with the loan agreement may vary according to your specific lender.<h3 class=title>Implications of Non-Payment</h3><p>It’s important to understand that when you accept your loan, it establishes an agreement between yourself and your respective lender that is legally binding. Receiving a loan can become highly problematic if you do not adhere to the agreed upon repayment structure, as this can cause additional fees and interest and your lender reporting your loan as delinquent, when can negatively impact your credit score. A poor credit score can impact your ability to secure future loans or important future agreements like a home mortgage, automobile financing, etc. If you do pay on time consistently however, this can have a positive impact on your credit score.<p>If payments become late, it’s likely that additional collection fee and/or interest will accrue on your loan, in addition to the existing interest on the outstanding balance. You will also be legally liable to repay your lender any expenses or costs incurred while trying to recover your loan.<p>As such, there are a few important notes to keep in mind before you proceed to secure your loan:<ul class=styled-list-circle><li>Do NOT accept a loan agreement if you will have difficulty paying it back.<li>If you have any difficulty with repayment, contact your lender immediately and ideally, before a missed payment actually occurs.</ul><h3 class=title>Instalment loan renewal policy</h3><p>If you require additional funding after your initial loan has come due, your lender may be willing to renew your loan. Contacting your lender individually is the best way to learn about their loan renewal policy and if this may be the right decision for you.<p>Our lenders typically charge the same or improved rates if you have successfully repaid a loan with them in the past, making you eligible for improved offers in the future. All of our pre-selected lenders will require you to affirm that you can afford your loan, regardless of size and tenor, and if you decide to renew a loan you should consider your ability to promptly repay an utmost priority.<p>Delayed or delinquent payment can lead to more interest and fees being added to your account and can result in a negatively impacted credit score as well.<p>When you require your next cash infusion, Oxygen Loans will work to find you the right pre-approved lender to make your cash available as soon as possible, often rendering a direct deposit to be made available in 10-minutes or less after approval.<p>We specialize in instalment loans to spread your require repayments out over a number of months, which serves as an excellent alternative to both short-term and payday loans.
